FTM_V3_1layers_noDLC.inp                   --> models without dlc / electrodes
FTM_V3_2layers_noDLC.inp                   --> i believe they are not correct because
FTM_V3_2layers_noDLC_checkstructure.inp    --> HV is set over the entire AREA, so also over the hole ...

FTM_V1_1layers_noDLC.inp		   --> approach to implement FTM v1 (50um kapton, conical hole)
FTM_V1_1layers_noDLC_workinprogress.inp    --> but with with wrong assumption as above ...
                                           --> to be discareded


FTM_V3_2layers_25umXC_v0.inp                  --> original, works only if one meshes all ... 
FTM_V3_2layers_25umXC_v0_checkstructure.inp   --> meshing only GAS & PI does not work because of
                                              --> forgotten lines (for all meshing strategies):
                                              --> VSEL, S,,,1,12
                                              --> ASLV, S
FTM_V3_2layers_25umXC_v1.inp                  --> model with PI+DLC+PI+DLC+GAS+DLC (6 layers)
                                              --> works also when meshing only GAS & PI

FTM_V3_2layers_25umXC_v2.inp                  --> model with PI+PI+DLC+GAS (4 layers)
FTM_V3_2layers_25umXC_v2_checkstructure.inp   --> works also when meshing only GAS & PI


FTM_V3_2layers_10nmXC_v1.inp                  --> model v1 (6 layers: PI+DLC+PI+DLC+GAS+DLC)
                                              --> with 10nm dlc instead of 25um XC kapton
                                              --> gives some computational issues
                                              --> we will need to try again with 100nm dlc
